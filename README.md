# MMA2Converter
Made to easily make 360 Beat Saber maps in MMA2 without losing a event track.

### Releases
So I've got it running, should just need Java 8 (which you probably have installed).

### Other
Currently the output file names aren't the best, but I'll fix that later.

When mapping in MMA2: 
Left Laser - event 14 (0-7)
Right Laser - event 15 (0-7)
See the [BSMG Wiki](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/extended-mapping.html#rotation-events-and-values) for more info as to what this means
Laser speed: 8 = 0, 9 = 1, 10 = 2, etc..
